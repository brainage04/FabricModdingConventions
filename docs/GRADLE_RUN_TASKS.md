# Gradle run tasks

The `run*` and `record*` tasks a multi-loader mod gets from `io.github.brainage04.multiloader-mod-conventions`, run from the mod's root. Anything that runs one loader lives in that loader's project and has the same name on both loaders; the root only has tasks that span both.

## Development (dev environment, sources on the classpath)

| Task | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `:fabric:runClient` / `:neoforge:runClient` | Dev client with the mod and DevAuth (DevAuth signs in only if enabled in `~/.config/devauth/config.toml`) |
| `:fabric:runServer` / `:neoforge:runServer` | Dev dedicated server |
| `:fabric:runGameTest` | Fabric server GameTests in the dev environment |
| `:neoforge:runGameTest` | NeoForge server GameTests in the dev environment |
| `:fabric:run<Name>GameTest` / `:neoforge:run<Name>GameTest` | One [integration GameTest suite](../README.md#integration-gametests) in the dev environment, with its extra mods; only its filtered GameTests run |

## Release jar (production environment)

| Task | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `:fabric:runProductionServerGameTest` | Fabric server GameTests on a production Fabric server, against the release jar |
| `:fabric:runProductionClientGameTest` | Fabric client GameTests in a production Fabric client under Xvfb; does nothing when `fabricClientGameTests = false` |
| `:fabric:recordClientGameTest` | The same client GameTests, recorded to video (Xvfb, PipeWire, ffmpeg); skipped when client GameTests are off |
| `:neoforge:runProductionServerGameTest` | NeoForge server GameTests on a real NeoForge server installed with the official installer, against the release jar; skipped when `neoForgeGameTests = false` |
| `:fabric:runProduction<Name>GameTest` / `:neoforge:runProduction<Name>GameTest` | One integration GameTest suite on the same production servers as `runProductionServerGameTest`, with the suite's JAR and its extra mods added |

There is no NeoForge client GameTest task: NeoForge has no client GameTest framework.

Production GameTest runs and integration GameTest suite runs are never up to date: every invocation starts the game, so a changed environment (such as a test filter in `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`) or a rerun after a flaky failure always runs the tests.

Fabric server GameTests start with a fresh world on every invocation: `runGameTest` and `runProductionServerGameTest` delete only `<runDir>/world` before launching, including with a custom run directory. This applies to both single-loader Fabric mods and multi-loader mods; logs, options, EULA files and other run-directory contents are preserved. NeoForge's development and production GameTest entrypoint already replaces its test world through vanilla's GameTest main, so it needs no additional reset. Integration GameTest suite runs delete `<runDir>/world` on both loaders.

## Root

| Task | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `runAllGameTests` | Every GameTest run, one at a time even with `--parallel`: `:fabric:runGameTest`, `:neoforge:runGameTest`, each integration GameTest suite's `:fabric:run<Name>GameTest` and `:neoforge:run<Name>GameTest`, `:fabric:runProductionServerGameTest`, `:fabric:runProductionClientGameTest` (when enabled), `:neoforge:runProductionServerGameTest`, then each suite's `:fabric:runProduction<Name>GameTest` and `:neoforge:runProduction<Name>GameTest`. The Fabric server runs, including the suites' Fabric runs, are left out for `mod_side=client` and with `fabricServerGameTests = false`; the NeoForge runs, including the suites', are skipped with `neoForgeGameTests = false`. |

Each run has its own run directory: `fabric/build/run/gameTest`, `neoforge/run/gametest`, `fabric/build/run/productionServerGameTest`, `fabric/build/run/clientGameTest` and `neoforge/build/run/productionServerGameTest`; a suite's runs use `<loader>/build/run/<name>GameTest` and `<loader>/build/run/production<Name>GameTest`.

## Tasks that do nothing

Loom also creates `:common:runClient`, `:common:runServer` and `:common:runClientRenderDoc`. `common` has no loader and the conventions clear its run configurations, so these tasks are skipped. Use the `:fabric:` or `:neoforge:` task instead.
