# Publishing

Publishing is configured for Sonatype Central via the OSSRH Staging API compatibility service, matching the HudRendererLib release setup.

Before publishing, create a Sonatype Central account, verify the `io.github.brainage04` namespace, generate a Central Portal user token, and create a GPG key for signing releases.

## Secret handling

Never store publishing secrets in `~/.bashrc`, `$PROFILE`, project files, Gradle command-line arguments, or a repository `.env` file.

### Local workstation

Store the Central Portal token in a password manager. Keep the signing private key in the local GnuPG keyring and let `gpg-agent` provide its passphrase.

Configure only the non-secret GPG selector in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
signing.gnupg.executable=gpg
signing.gnupg.keyName=<long-signing-key-id>
```

The owner workstation provides `unlock-central-publishing`, `with-central-publishing`, and `lock-central-publishing` helpers. Unlock once to create a mode-`0600` Bitwarden CLI session under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; each `with-central-publishing` invocation retrieves the Portal token, exposes it only to the child command, and leaves that session available for subsequent publishing commands. Run `lock-central-publishing` when the publishing session is finished.

Prime `gpg-agent` once before running Gradle so parallel signing tasks do not open competing pinentry prompts. On a remote terminal without access to the desktop pinentry, use loopback mode; GPG reads the passphrase as hidden terminal input and caches the unlocked key in the normal per-user agent:

```bash
signing_check="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/central-publishing-signing-check"
printf 'Central publishing signing check\n' > "$signing_check"
GPG_TTY="$(tty)" gpg --yes --pinentry-mode loopback \
  --local-user <long-signing-key-id> \
  --detach-sign --output "$signing_check.sig" "$signing_check"
rm -f "$signing_check" "$signing_check.sig"
unset signing_check
```

### CI

CI may continue using secret-store-provided environment variables:

- `CENTRAL_PORTAL_USERNAME`
- `CENTRAL_PORTAL_PASSWORD`
- `SIGNING_KEY`
- `SIGNING_PASSWORD`

The build uses in-memory PGP signing when the signing environment variables are present and GPG-agent signing when `useGpgAgentSigning=true`.

## Publish

On the owner workstation, unlock once and then run as many publishing commands as needed:

```bash
unlock-central-publishing
with-central-publishing ./gradlew --no-daemon :publishToMavenCentral
```

The root task stages the runtime artifact plus all six component plugin markers and implementation modules, then performs one Central Portal deployment finalization.

By default, the staged deployment is uploaded to the Central Portal for manual review (`user_managed` mode). To ask Sonatype to release automatically after validation, run:

```bash
with-central-publishing ./gradlew --no-daemon :publishToMavenCentral -PcentralPublishingType=automatic
```

Lock the reusable vault session explicitly when publishing is complete:

```bash
lock-central-publishing
```
